# This is a simple banking application, based on the Vbucks currency from Fortnite.
#       Built in Java, uses Maven to manage dependencies, connects to a PostgreSQL database using the JDBC
# Functionality includes creating a Player account, and for each player any number of Checking/Savings accounts
# Players can deposit or withdraw Vbucks from their accounts, as well as gift Vbucks to another player
# Players can also add other players to their Vbucks accounts (Joint accounts) to share the wealth
# But beware! Vbucks scamming is a big deal. Periodically, while banking with us, you will be asked to earn free Vbucks. Don't fall for the trap!

# To operate, run the SQL scripts file to create the database
# Afterward, run App.java to begin the application, then follow in-console prompts.
